I did not integrate my job control ds into the shell. I have moved on to other things in the interest of continuing to produce work this quarter. I thought I had it figured out but then snowpocalypse happened and I lost momentum as well as my thought process. If you see any clues that might help me to get this code back on track I'd gladly like to finish the lab, but I must move on to keep forward progress.

pre-power outage I had gotten through problem 2 (i think) in 11.8.2. But that no longer works and things seem rather mangled at this point
